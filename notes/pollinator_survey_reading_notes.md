### How to assess insect biodiversity without wasting your time
"the initial definition of objectives is especially important so that studies will answer specific questions, not just generate isolated sets of general information."

A bottleneck in many insect studies is identification, needs al ot more time and expertise than catching, and it is easy to accumulate a large collection and run out of resources and time for identifying

"Because there are so many insects, however, it is difficult to obtain a balanced picture of what is required for such assessments, given finite resources."

Ecological importance of insects makes them valuable to assess disturbance of various kinds (habitat destruction, pop'n changes, changes in community structure)

High diversity means a study can detect relatively inconspicuous but important changes

Necessary Constants:
- Site selection
- Taxon selection (method of capturing, for ex. moth traps, pan traps)
- Level of identification
- Data management
- Project as a whole, the 'final question'
- Dissemination of information

Rough ratio of time management:
Pan traps (3x, set every two weeks): 0.5 hrs setting, 0.5 hours collecting, 24 hrs in Fridge, ~2 hrs drying and pinning, ~10 hrs identifying

Often is it better to have specific information on carefully chosen groups than family-level information on many. Species leve linformation are the functioning entities, families have diverse habitats

Systematics expertise (identifying to species or genus rather than family) is of most importance to the project objectives

--> you may want to spend most of your time on Bumblebees, because 1. it does not always require the use of a microscope 2. we have a great ID resources, 3. they are a larger charismatic species to display in our nature house, 4. range shifts are occurring with temperature shifts and  5. their diversity is high on the west coast of NA

### Bumblebees of North America notes
"When planting for bumble bees, select plants with different blooming periods and different shapes and colours. The longer-tongued bumblebee species prefer flowers with long corollas such as Beardtongues (Penstemon) and Larkspurs (Delphinium). Bumblebees with shorter tongues occassionally nectar rob from flowers with long corollas, but they generally prefer shallower flowers such as goldenrods (Solidago) and Sunflowers (Helianthus). By planting a variety of plants that will bloom throughout the spring, summer and fall, you will provide several "
