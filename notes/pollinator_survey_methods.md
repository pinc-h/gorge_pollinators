## Introduction
#### What the survey is
The goal of this survey is to assess the insect biodiversity in a restored meadow in Esquimalt Gorge Park: the Pollinator Meadow. This meadow is sectioned-off from the public and has had extensive ecological restoration done since 2020. Since then, native plants have been seeded and invasives are continually pulled. A biophysical inventory has been conducted every year to gauge the abundance of different species of plants. This insect survey is best done by an undergraduate student or recent graduate with experience in entomology and using a dichotomous key. 
#### Why conduct the survey
Native plants have long evolutionary relationships with local bees. British Columbia (and the west coast of North America in general) is home to staggering bee diversity. Solitary bees, as opposed to cultivated honeybees or bumblebees, make up the majority of species in British Columbia. Solitary bees are important crop-pollinators, while also being critical to native flowers. Some flowers depend solely on these insects for pollination. Insects are threatened by habitat degradation and climate change. Academic studies have begun to show range-shifts northward in many species of bees as annual temperatures rise. We can show with this survey that planting native plants can increase the number of pollinators in the park, increasing ecosystem health as a whole.

## Methods
#### Broad overview
There are two components to collecting insects for the survey: pan traps and visitation sampling. Visitation sampling is completed by hand-netting pollinators as they land on flowers. This is best conducted once a week on a sunny day without wind. Insects are caught in the pollinator meadow over a specific time-window and in specific zones (see Details). The date, time, catcher, zone and species of flower is recorded on a slip of paper and placed in a vial with the caught insect. This data is later entered into our `Specimen Catalogue` for that year. Once all zones are covered, vials are placed in the Nature House freezer for 24 hours.

The second component is pan trapping, best conducted once every two weeks. Coloured bowls with water and soap are placed together inside the Pollinator Meadow and at an unrestored Control Garden site near the parking lot. The unrestored site, with it's proximity to human structures and abundance of invasive plants, acts as our control. Bowls are left out for 48 hours, then collected. For how the insects are collected, see Details. and

## ID-ing

Identification to Genus is the most valuable data we can accrue, however the time this takes is exponentially higher than collecting. Given time constraints, identifying to Family is useful for a few of the basic assessments in the Pollinator Meadow Survey. With identifying to family we can look at what broad groups of pollinators are attracted to which flowers. You may find with the keys that it is sometimes it is easier to identify to genus than family because of the distinctiveness of specific genera (for example Agapostemon in Halictidae, or Bombus in Apidae).

Some resources, such as "How to assess insect biodiversity" caution against identifying to family because of how large some insect families are. Within the same family could be species with vastly different diet and lifestyle, which limits our capacity to make changes in the Pollinator Meadow to help these species. It would be impossible, for instance, to say Halictids (Order) like blue coloured flowers. It may be possible though, to say Megachile spp. need broad-leaved shrubs for nest building.

Consult the dichotomous keys listed in the Resources section of this document, these should be available in the Staff Google Drive, and are also available online. There are two websites that are also useful for identification: https://bugguide.net/

These resources will get you close to what you're looking at the majority of the time. Consult iNaturalist and/or the Bumblebees of North America book to see if this species has been observed on Vancouver Island.

## Helpful Resources
Resources in the Nature House:
These physical resources are extremely valuable. You can reference them even when the Wi-Fi is spotty and they contain most information on the importance of the survey and 

Books: 
- Bumblebees of North America
	- Connor Nelson introduced this book to me as the Bumblebee Bible. With this, you can confidently get an individual to species. The broad key at the beginning of the book is the most valuable. Remember the most important rules of thumb for IDing: "Has this been seen here before? Does this look like anything we've caught before?" 
- How to Assess Insect Biodiversity without wasting your time
	- Read if you have the time. This goes into further detail than available here for why insect biodiversity is important and how one can accurately assess it.
