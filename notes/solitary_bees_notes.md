Wild solitary bees are effective but unappreciated pollinators of many economically important crops, including apples and other early spring flowering trees, blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, watermelons, eggplants, tomatoes squash, pumpkins and even coffee

These four families are key to understanding bee origins because they are the closest non-pollen-feeding relatives of bees (Heterogynaidae, Ampulicidae, Sphecidae, Crabronidae)
The family Crabronidae shares many features with bees, including a subterranean nest, central place foraging and landmark learning.

Apidae -- Apinae: majority social, some solitary, some brood parasites
Megachilidae -- Megachilinae: some brood parasites, no social, mostly solitary
Halictidae -- Halictinae: some solitary, some social, few brood and social parasites
Colletidae -- All solitary.
Andrenidae -- Anreninae -- all solitary
Melittidae -- Mellitinae -- all solitary.

Pollen feeding has evolved two other times from within predatory wasps. The wasp subfamily Masarinae (or pollen wasps) arose from within a predominantely predatory group of wasps in the family Vespidae. Predatory Vespidae include the potter wasps (Eumeninae), hover wasps (Stenogastrinae) oprimitively eusocial paper wasps (Polistinae) and highly eusocial yellow jackets (Vespinae)

Within the genus Lasioglossum alone, there are as many as 12 reversals from eusociality back to solitaty nesting -- Danforth 2002, Danforth et al 2003

pg 35
Fu and colleages (2015) demonstrate mathematically that while solitary nesting is a low-risk fairly conservative strategy, eusociality is a high risk but very rewarding strategy. This is because the initial investment in wokrer production by eusocial species effectively delays the production of reproductives. If colonies die off during the worker phase, they are reproductive dead ends and go extinct

pg 68
the megachilid bees have unusually high lifetime reproductive success compared to other ground or stem nesting bees. As we shall see in a later chapter, foraging and provisioning in megachilid bees is strikingly different from those behaviours in other bees. This trait may be related to the use of a metasomal scopa that puts limits on the amount of pollen that can be carried per trip.

pg 78
In Anthidium (Megachilidae), dominant males defend territories in patches of flowers attractive to females, a strategy referred to as resource defense polygyny. There is considerable intra-specific variation in body size in male Anthidium, with large males typically as large as or even larger than females, contrary to the usual pattern in bees. As one might expect, large males usually hold territories, with small males relegated to the periphery. Territory holders typically attempt to mate with any conspecific females but are not always successful. Females can reject male advances entirely or copulate briefly with the territory holder and return to foraging.
