# Pollinator Insect Survey
## Overview
  
A meadow in Esquimalt Gorge Park, Victoria B.C. has been seeded with native plants continually since 2020 in the hopes of attracting a greater diversity of insect pollinators. This project analyzes insects collected from this rehabilitated meadow, assesses plant-pollinator specificity, and genera abundance. Many of the contributors to this project are students or recent BSc. graduates from the University of Victoria, identifying to species (and even genus) is an ongoing process.

## Methods
Insects were collected by pan traps and handnetting from a pollinator meadow in Esquimalt Gorge Park. Handnetting occurred weekly for set time intervals and pan traps were set for 48 hours every two weeks. The meadow was divided into four zones of roughly equal area, where insects were caught with a handnet in single 20 minute intervals in each zone. Insects were caught if they landed on and looked to be pollinating a flower. Three pan traps had a small amount of soap and were placed in the middle of the meadow. Three pan traps were also set in a control site, close to a parking lot, with no ecological restoration done. Pan traps were collected after 48 hours and insects were then strained and dried. Only pollinating species were kept. The first and last day of sampling were June 7 and August 18 2024, respectively.

<br><i>Fig 1: Sampling over time.</i> Weekly sampling was conducted between May and August 2023 and 2024. In some weeks, the pan traps collected a large number of specimens but showed a low number of genera among the sample. Conversely, hand-netting frequently resulted in a greater number of genera but lower number of caught specimens.

<br><i>Fig 2: Distribution of genera.</i>   The most strictly abundant genera sampled across both 2023 and 2024 were <i>Bombus spp.</i> (Bumble bees), <i>Dianthidium spp.</i> (Pebble bees), <i>Lasioglossum spp.</i> (sweat bees), and <i>Andrena spp.</i> (mining bees). Most samples remaining to be identified to genus belong to the families Andrenidae, Crabronidae, and Halictidae. Identifying Andrenids to <i>Andrena spp.</i> has proven difficult for beginner taxonomists as their characteristic facial fovea are hard to spot. It is likely most Crabronids are <i>Philanthus spp.</i>, given that there is not much variation and Bee-wolves are a common seen species on Goldenrod (<i>Solidago spp.</i>). Halictids are likely <i>Lasioglossum spp.</i> or <i>Halictus spp.</i>, time is the remaining limiting factor to that group's identification. The number of specimens unidentified to family is quite large, and is the major focus of our identification process.

<br><i>Fig. 3: Plant associations of genera.</i> In the pollinator meadow the most active plants (the species upon which the most pollinators were caught) were Yarrow (<i>Achillea millefolium</i>), Goldenrod (<i>Solidago spp.</i>), and Douglas Aster (<i>Symphyotrichum subspicatum</i>). Pebble Bees (<i>Dianthidium spp.</i>) were fairly common on all of these plants, but showed much more on Gumweed (<i>Grindelia intergrifolia</i>). Bumble bees (<i>Bombus spp.</i>) were caught exclusively on Douglas Aster and Snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>), but in extremely low number. European Woolcarder Bee (<i>Anthidium manicatum</i>) was caught in high number across only two plants, Self-heal (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i>) and Henderson's Checkermallow (<i>Sidalcea hendersonii</i>). It is likely a few large <i>A. manicatum </i>males claimed this area as territory and thus attracted females and smaller males as sexual competitors.

<br><i>Fig. 4: Plant activity over time.</i> Rough flowering times can be elucidated from when the majority of insects were collected on specific plants. The most specimens were caught on Douglas Aster (<i>Symphyotrichum subspicatum</i>) in August 2023, corresponding with their known late-summer blooming period. In 2024, most Wooly Sunflower (<i>Eriophyllum lanatum</i>) in the meadow finished blooming by mid-July, and no insects were subsequently found on <i>E. lanatum</i> in our sampling methods.
