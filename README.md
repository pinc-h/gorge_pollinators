A meadow in Esquimalt Gorge Park, Victoria B.C. has been seeded with native plants continually since 2020 in the hopes of attracting a greater diversity of insect pollinators. This project analyzes insect species data collected from this rehabilitated meadow, assesses plant-pollinator specificity, and genera abundance.
