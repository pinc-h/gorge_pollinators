A meadow in Esquimalt Gorge Park, Victoria B.C. has been seeded with native plants continually since 2020 in the hopes of attracting a greater diversity of insect pollinators. This project analyzes insects collected from this rehabilitated meadow, assesses plant-pollinator specificity, and genera abundance. Many of the contributors to this project are students or recent BSc. graduates from the University of Victoria, identifying to species (and even genus) is an ongoing process.

## 1. Methods
Insects were collected by pan traps and handnetting from a pollinator meadow in Esquimalt Gorge Park. Handnetting occurred weekly for set time intervals and pan traps were set for 48 hours every two weeks. The meadow was divided into four zones of roughly equal area, where insects were caught with a handnet in single 20 minute intervals in each zone. Insects were caught if they landed on and looked to be pollinating a flower. Three pan traps had a small amount of soap and were placed in the middle of the meadow. Three pan traps were also set in a control site, close to a parking lot, with no ecological restoration done. Pan traps were collected after 48 hours and insects were then strained and dried. Only pollinating species were kept. The first and last day of sampling were June 7 and August 18 2024, respectively.
